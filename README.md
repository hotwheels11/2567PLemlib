# 2567P Repository

Hi! I'm Logan, the main programmer for Team 2567P. This repository contains all of our autonomous programs for the season.  

We use:
- **Lemlib** Supports both PID and Odom, both work great  
- **titanselect** Auto Selector Compatible with Lemlib
- **Odometry** For accurate robot positioning
- **Coordinate System** Allows us to view the cords of the robot via the brain screen
- **Distance Sensor Reset** Used for skills, as long as we place the robot at the right heading, we can place the robot with confidence anywhere near the zone with an error of +-.1-.3 in

Feel free to reference this code for your personal projects, or make a local clone with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotwheels11/2567PLemlib
```
⚠️ **Note:** This repo is custom for us, so you may need to look through in order to find something you're missing  

Happy coding!
