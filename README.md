# 2567P Autonomous Code Repository

Hi! I'm Logan, the main programmer for Team 2567P. This repository contains all of our autonomous programs for the season.  

We use:
- **Lemlib** for drivetrain and PID control  
- **RoboDash** (currently being implemented)  
- **Odometry** for accurate robot positioning  

Feel free to reference this code for your personal projects, or make a local clone with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotwheels11/2567PLemlib
```
⚠️ **Note:** This repository contains all of our files. You can either clone individual autonomous files or wait for PROS to let you select which project you want to open.  

Happy coding!
